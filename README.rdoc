==BYE~NY

BYE~NY takes every flight that departed yesterday from the three major New York City airports - EWR, JFK, and LGA - and displays them based on their departure time and continent of destination.


The animation is portrayed over a 24 hour period. Each "burst" of color represents all of the flights that departed in that 15 minute time period. Furthermore, each line is an individual flight whose continent of destination is represented by the line's color.
